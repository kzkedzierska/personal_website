# Analog photography

In my spare time I like to take photos with one of the old cameras. I quite enjoy the lomography style of taking photos (*Lomography* is a photographic style which involves taking spontaneous photographs with minimal attention to technical details; source [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_camera#Lomography)). I also like to experiment with shooting photos. 

I decided to post the photos on my website to make myself choose the shots I like best and keep them for my records.
