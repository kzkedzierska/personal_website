I led this course, with help from [Duncan Parkes](https://github.com/duncanparkes), two years in a row. This 2-hour tutorial is designed to:
- explain basic concepts of Git
- highlight the benefits of version control and Git
- show the pivotal commands.

The slides, containing screenshots of executed commands, are available via [bit.ly/Git_repo](http://bit.ly/Git_repo). The repository with exercises and solutions is available at [bit.ly/intro_to_git](http://bit.ly/intro_to_git).
