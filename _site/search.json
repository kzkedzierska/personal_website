I quite enjoy the lomography style of taking photos (Lomography is a photographic style which involves taking spontaneous photographs with minimal attention to technical details; source wiki). I also like to experiment with shooting photos.\nI decided to post the photos on my website to make myself choose the shots I like best and keep them for my records.\n\nShot in Boston, July 2023 with Praktica BX20 on Kodak Color Plus, ISO 200 (pushed +1)."
