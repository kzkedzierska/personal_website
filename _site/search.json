This will result in 2048 bit RSA key.\nssh-keygen\nFirst we will be asked as to where to save the key?\n~$ ssh-keygen\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):\nI keep my keys in the default directory, but like to name them as I use keys for multiple things (connecting to the server, GitHub and more). Remember to put the whole path for the key (or navigate to the directory you want to store your key), otherwise it will be saved in a current directory.\nNext, we are asked for passphrase. If you wish not to have a password protected key (i.e.Â donâ€™t want to prompted for a password every time you use it, just press enter). It is recommended though to encrypt the key so that it cannot be used by someone who shouldnâ€™t otherwise have access. For strong passwords I either use my KeePassXC random generator or use one of the online tools.\n~$ ssh-keygen\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/username/.ssh/work_server\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/work_server\nYour public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/work_server.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:sP/uJ20hblyGGlQGf4/iASWXU10cEUwdtVbjk8nbh0g username@yoga\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[RSA 2048]----+\n|        o.oo..oX@|\n|         ==   +.O|\n|      . .o..E  O |\n|       o.. o +..+|\n|      ..S o.o o.o|\n|       ...oo+   .|\n|        .=.= .   |\n|        ..= +    |\n|         +++     |\n+----[SHA256]-----+\nThere is much more to the ssh-keygen program than whatâ€™s described above, I definately recommend giving a manual a read! For example you may wish to increase the number of bits to 4048 by specifing it with -b 4048, or add a comment to the key with -C \"dell machine\". You can access the info about the program by simply typing:\nman ssh-keygen"
