It's that time of the year again‚Äîtime to solve programming puzzles and help elves save Christmas! üéÑüéÖ

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual event where programmers tackle daily coding challenges leading up to Christmas. Each day brings a new puzzle that tests logic, problem-solving, and programming skills. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, it's a fun and festive way to hone your skills!

This year I am solving the puzzles in Python and writing down the solutions in blog style posts using Quarto flavored Jupyter Notebooks. Usually, I don't have time to solve all the puzzles, especially when the work gets busy, the puzzles get harder and it's time to prepare for Christmas. But I will try my best to solve as many as possible. Who knows -- maybe this year I will manage to solve them all! ü§û

## Give it a try!

If you're interested in solving the puzzles yourself, head over to the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/). You can start at any time and work at your own pace. It's a great way to challenge yourself, learn new things, and have fun during the holiday season. Happy coding! üéÑüéÖ

## Appreciation for the author

Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/). I am very grateful for his work and dedication to creating these puzzles every year. It's a great way to learn new programming skills, practice problem-solving, have fun, and feel like one is part of an interesting community. The latter being especially important for me during my lonely Corona PhD and working remotely. Thank you! üôè
